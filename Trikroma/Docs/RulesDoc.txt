//trikroma//

>> Introduction
trikroma is an abstract tile-based puzzle game for iOS/Android devices.
Players tap and drag triangular tiles called TRIs to add/subtract colors
to/from adjacent tiles until they accomplish the puzzle's objective.

>> Colors
TRIs can be of one of eight colors: Red (R), Green (G), Blue (B), Yellow (Y),
Fuchsia (F), Aqua (A), White (W) and Black (K). The colors that certain TRIs
are in will determine whether the puzzle's objective has been accomplished.

>> Addition
When tapping and dragging across a "+" sign, the source TRI's color is added
to the destination TRI's color. The following are all valid additions:

> R + K = R		> G + K = G		> B + K = B
> R + G = Y		> G + B = A		> B + R = F
> Y + K = Y		> F + K = F		> A + K = A
> Y + B = W		> A + R = W		> F + G = W
> Y + A = W		> Y + F = W		> A + F = W

>> Subtraction
When tapping and dragging across a "-" sign, the source TRI's color is subtracted
from the destination TRI's color. The following are all valid subtractions:

> W - R = A		> W - G = F		> W - B = Y
> W - A = R		> W - Y = B		> W - F = G
> A - G = B		> A - B = G		> Y - R = G
> Y - G = R		> F - B = R		> F - R = B
> A - Y = B		> A - F = G		> Y - A = R
> Y - F = G		> F - Y = B		> F - A = R
